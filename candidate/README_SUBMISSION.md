# Submission Notes (Candidate)

Replace this file with your short write-up. Include:

- Overview of load strategy (Keboola components used, full vs incremental) and idempotency approach.
- Data quality handling (NULLs, trimming, quotes, date/time parsing, bad rows). Any COPY/format options used in Keboola.
- Assumptions, schema/type decisions, and any trade-offs.
- Exact steps to re-run end-to-end: load → transform → QC.
